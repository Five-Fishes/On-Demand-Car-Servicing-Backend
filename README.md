# On-Demand-Car-Servicing-Backend

## Getting Started
I personally recommend using VSC (Visual Studio Code)

## Node Installation
To make sure you are able to develop, make sure you have node version **12.++** (The long term support version) installed. To test you have Node installed:
- Open up terminal/cmd
```
node -v
```
- You should expect result like
```
node -v
v12.18.3
```
- If you encounter any error, please ask in team or download the LTS **Node** version

## Project Setup
Once you have node installed, you can start the development. To set up the project, do:

- Open up terminal/cmd
- Type the following to open open up the project using VSC
``` 
code "path to project" 
``` 
- In VSC, press ``` ctrl + ` ``` to open up terminal
- To install project dependencies type (must be performed on first time):
``` 
npm i 
``` 

## Development
To start the server locally, do:
```
npx nodemon .
```
The command above allows hot reloading of the project

## Git Flow
Members have to strictly folow the gitflow provided by Atlassian Bitbucket, for more info please see [here](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow)
